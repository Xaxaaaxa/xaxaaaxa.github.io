<span id="more"></span>
<p>Finally, she was gone.</p>
<p>It was not a murder, and I was not the murderer. Honestly, it was not a lie.</p>
<p>But how could there still be a sense of guilt haunting my mind? Why were there sounds shrieking at me? No, no! Stop wailing, mumbling, and swearing nonsense at me, for I was innocent. Not only the fact but also a common belief should it be, that there had never been a murderer, and that she deserved the end. It was a suicide, as they said. – Indeed it was, so it was.</p>
<p><span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>I’m sorry,<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> I bowed my head to avoid the eyes surrounding my bed, and spoke with a mournful voice. Yet vague whispers kept sneaking into my ear, striking my brain through the air. Without any check I could already imagine the way they exchanged their looks, how they scanned me thoroughly with either a sneaky glimpse or an assaulting gaze, and how comments were stealthily transmitted among your audience through their overt but ambiguous mime.</p>
<p>Yet there was no reason for me to be afraid. Few people knew the conflicts between us. And they had confirmed that I did nothing but fainted from shock. Maybe something did happen, or a dialogue did take place. Yet there were only two of us, and never would a third one know the truth. Never would they hear the words. Never would the words - her last words --Oh what vicious curses! --Never would they come true. --Nothing could frighten me anymore. Fright makes people fail. It produces cowards, cowards like her.</p>
<p>Please don’t get me wrong. Long had we been friends. Motivation there was none for me to commit a murder. Her parents were great to me. She was also good to me. Though detest and discords did exist between us, she had never insisted me wrong. --Or I might say, she had seldom thought anyone wrong. Yet I also blamed her for that, as only cowards never fought back, and hardly would people realize or appreciate her silent tolerance - they would take it only as an acquiescence. The outburst she vented at last, would be nothing but a bridle wrongly let go, emotions poorly managed, and an immature personality too fragile to fit the society. --Listen to the surrounding gossip, watch their scanning eyes! Hardly can you deny me. Admit it.</p>
<p>Again, do not get me wrong. I was by no means cynical. Be honest, similar vicious beliefs must have also occurred to you ever. Your conscience might have concealed them, yet I am frank. Don’t feel ashamed, it is indeed the way the world works. --Those that compromise will fail. Those who can’t stand will lose. --None of them would I be. Nothing wrong had I done. Nothing would frighten me. --I would prevail. I believed.</p>
<p>Annoying gossips kept permeating the room, which they thought that I could not detect. What naive people! Even if I couldn’t, I would know what they were whispering - why such trivial things, why so vulnerable… - naive beliefs! How could they believe --An impulsion rose inside me but --No, I should never talk back! --We had long hidden the real causes under the surface. --In the damp, dark soil, they had grown deep and convoluted. Never would we dig them out. It would do no good. It could only bring us nothing but trouble.</p>
<p>So I went out of my bed, walked out of the room without a word, and shut the voices inside the door. The whisperings, not only those in the room, but those inside me, were calling me up to the loft. The moment I stepped onto the wooden floor, a familiar smell of paint rushed into my nose. --For the first time since I woke up, I felt a sense of ease. --It was where we belong, I remembered her speaking.</p>
<p>On the floor there were small pieces of canvas scattered all around. On each of them was a similar faint figure with different motions, tortured, as you may describe them, in different scenes. --For months we had been working on them. I knew all their faces - they were dying. --Some of them were crushed in car accidents, drowned in waters, or lying on a train rail … some were pierced by thorns through their bodies, or trapped deeply in a piece of ice … One of them was sitting on the edge of a rooftop, her hair blown up by strong wind, her feet swaying above the silent lanes at night.</p>
<p>All the figures suddenly turned their faces to me, and spoke at the same time. I heard a familiar voice, <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>…for hundreds of times… I’ve already died.<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span></p>
<p>I looked immediately to the other side of the loft, and found a figure standing right before the window, out of which was the rooftop where we had been. The sunlight behind blurred her face, yet I knew it was her staring at me. --I was by no means afraid. --The figure was only an illusion, I was clearly aware. --The sound came from nowhere but my memory. It was nothing but how she said about the implications she wished to mean - <span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-end"><h-inner>“</h-inner></h-char></span>If imagination could be realized, hundreds of times I would have already died.<span class="bd-box"><h-char class="bd bd-beg"><h-inner>”</h-inner></h-char></span> - Portraits of the abandoned souls; the desperate feelings constantly emerging, yet suppressed; the passive passions not ‘allowed’… --Yet no one would care, I had told her, no one, for thousands of times.</p>
<p>It might be cruel, but you have to agree, that it was the truth. Watch the coarse lines of brushes, the dull, amateur use of the colors! A wave of anger rose in my heart - the same anger that I had felt for her during the previous days, weeks, and years that I had spent with her, when I had to feel her struggles, and share her pains. --Would others really care about the feelings? Would they care if the scenes were true imaginations or fabricated tales? Would they care about the deaths, or the imaginations, or the minds? What else could the pictures be for the spectators? Nothing but pieces of colors! --What should matter? Your meaningless obstinacy? On your vague metaphors clumsily hidden? Of your cowardice escape from reality?</p>
<p>Her figure was trembling, and so was I. --Yet we were not the same, of course not. --It was so thrilling for me to impose all the bare truth to her, and she would be frightened while still trying to escape --I knew exactly, how she would wave her head, and withdraw backward step by step. --Yet I kept compelling her to the edge, forcing her to face my words, as I went on shouting at her. --Stop struggling with your damned ideas! Nothing should there be that is worth your pride, nothing! - They are only simple dichotomies! --You might be blaming me for disdaining human minds, yet how would you respond - what else could you propose? To live, or not to live; to face, or to escape; the dream, or the reality… What else! On either end we may choose to stand or on any place in between. --Neither should anyone be wrong, or another be blamed. --Thus how could us, as such the ordinaries, dream to persuade the others, to stand out with our poor voice? Nothing should be special about those poor works! None of the ideas! --So stop it! Leave your mind alone!</p>
<p>I bent down and picked up a piece of canvas in front of her figure. --On it was a figure confined in a narrow room, facing an old pendulum clock. Throughout the pendulum there was a crack, unfinished, abruptly slashing the picture with a striking line of bright red. --I had no memory of it. --My body was still trembling, even more fiercely. At that moment, my mind felt a series of strikes, like the regular, muffled sound of an old pendulum clock.</p>
<p>I looked again at her figure. It was still in front of the window. The sun was down, and I could see her face clearly. --Singularly I found no sign of fear, but a light smile, and her dark eyes deeply staring at me. --Suddenly I felt hard to stand the sights. --Why were you watching me in such a way? Why? Why was your smile so scornful, as I was telling things wrong? --No, stop it! How dare you to stare me in that way? You were the loser who chose to quit! Never try to threaten me! Never would I be frightened, never!</p>
<p>I wished to shout back the words, yet they were immersed by the strokes in my mind. While trying to sweep it off, I found her figure approaching me, her hands overlapping with mine, holding the canvas. The strike of the pendulum became louder, yet I could clearly hear the familiar voice from me inside. --True, the dichotomies. What a freedom…if it were true indeed! How I wish that it could be real, that we could really choose the stance. --Yet it was a fake pendulum; it was broken! Limits and restrictions were everywhere, and you would have no reason to break. --If you were right, thus your words, also theirs - the voices you hated - should also be stances between the ends, which should be nothing wrong. --Thus we kept silent, and you blamed me for that, while I kept silent still, for similarly, there was nothing to be blamed. --Yet why, listen! Why! Why was I - why were we - not allowed to make our own choices - ideas or forms; dream or reality; to live or not to live? Why?</p>
<p>The strike was once striking violently and suddenly went into silence. Her face was once tortured but soon went back to normal. She turned back to the window, and sat on the sill. Her hair was blown up by a gust of strong wind, as the figure in the painting, as the figure that night on the rooftop. Again I saw her raising her lips with a scornful smile. --You were right, to answer the questions - that we are the ordinaries, we are the cowards incapable of breaking the limits. --Here the life is left to you, since you believe that you could lead a better one. --Yet you will find, that nothing would change, for we share the same bone and flesh. We are doomed to be stuck, we the normal ones, the unlucky ones, attracted by dreams out of reach, and disappointed by the ungifted competence, stuck in the positioned place by the trap of the pendulum. --You would be just the same as me.</p>
<p>Nonsense, it was all nonsense! How could she disguise herself as a victim? It was nothing but a trick, concealing her true incompetence and cowardice with the blame of fate. Yet how could it be! We should be clear - nothing except oneself could do things wrong. It should all depend on us. Isn’t it how the world works? --I was fully aware, thus how could we be the same? How dare she curse me like that!</p>
<p>I turned back to the window to argue back, yet there was no one on the sill. --It was all the same as that night on the rooftop - that she left the curses, and then she disappeared. --Yet you should see now, that I was not the murderer. I had told nothing but the truth, and it was on her own that she chose to quit. --But how could there still be voices haunting my mind? --There was neither a murder, nor a murderer, I had made it clear. --What were you mumbling? Why? Why were you wailing?</p>
<p>I heard hurried steps on the stairs. Again I noticed my hands trembling. --Why were you here again? How could you belong to here, you ordinaries? --I could not help shaking my head, and stepping backward to the window. --Why were you keeping silent? Why couldn’t you speak? --Again I heard the pendulum striking, intermittently, with a loud, creaky, muffled sound. I looked down, finding new striking lines of bright red paint emerging on the paintings. --Stop it, please!</p>
<p>The wind on the rooftop was strong at night. I could hear them howling. I felt my hair blown up.</p>
